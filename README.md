# Machine-Learning

The code file consists of aspects that needs to be taken care of before applying in-built machine learning algorithms on data. Data file consists of spine data. Data Pre-processing includes:

    Handling outliers
    Feature Selection
    Handling data imbalance
    Data scaling
    Handling Missing values
    Model Selection
    Hyperparameter Tuning
    Machine Learning Metrics
